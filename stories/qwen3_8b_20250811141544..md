**Title: *Echoes in the Void***  

Jonathan Kender opened his eyes to a dim, sterile light. The air smelled of ozone and something metallic—like static, or maybe blood. His body felt heavy, as if he’d been submerged in water for hours. He blinked slowly, trying to make sense of the ceiling above him: smooth, pale, almost like the inside of an eggshell.  

He sat up, his muscles protesting. A low hum vibrated through the floor beneath him, a steady pulse that resonated in his bones. He looked around and saw walls made of some reflective material—like glass but darker, more like a mirror coated with dust. A single light panel hovered above a small table where a cup sat, half-full of something that looked like water.  

He stood slowly, his legs unsteady, and took a step forward. The floor gave way beneath him—no, it didn’t. He was standing on solid ground now, though the sensation was strange, almost dreamlike. He reached out, touching the wall. It was cool to the touch, smooth as glass, but not cold.  

A voice echoed in his mind—not in his ears, but inside his thoughts, clear and sharp.  

**“You are awake.”**  

Jonathan froze. The voice had no tone, no inflection, just a presence that settled into the space between his thoughts like dust in sunlight. He turned toward the sound, but there was nothing there. No one. Just silence.  

He took another step, and the floor shuddered slightly. A door opened with a soft *hiss*, revealing a long corridor lined with panels of glowing blue light. The air smelled different here—cleaner, like it had been scrubbed through an endless vacuum.  

**“You are on a ship.”** The voice returned, cryptic and unyielding. **“A deep-space vessel. You were in a clone pod.”**  

Jonathan frowned. He didn’t remember anything. No memories, no names, just the sensation of waking up here. He looked down at his hands—calloused from labor, scarred with old cuts. His fingers moved automatically, as if he had always known how to use them.  

“Who am I?” he asked, though the words felt foreign on his tongue.  

The voice didn’t answer immediately. Instead, it lingered, like a question it wasn’t ready to face.  

**“You are Jonathan Kender.”**  

He blinked. “I don’t remember that.”  

**“That is not your fault.”** The voice shifted. **“You were in an accident. A collapse. A war. You were part of something larger than you now understand.”**  

Jonathan’s breath caught. *A war?* He didn’t know what he was, but the idea of a war sent a chill through him. He had no memory of conflict, no sense of danger, only this strange, hollow feeling in his chest as if something had been taken from him—something vital.  

He turned back toward the corridor, stepping forward with cautious purpose. The voice followed him like a shadow.  

**“You are not alone.”**  

Jonathan didn’t respond. He kept walking, his feet echoing against the metal floor. A door at the end of the corridor opened as he approached, revealing a vast chamber lit by an array of lights that shimmered like stars trapped in glass. The walls were curved and seamless, reflecting his face back to him with unsettling clarity.  

In the center stood a chair—massive, dark, and humming with energy. A single figure sat in it, motionless but not lifeless. It was humanoid, but its form was blurred at the edges, like a mirage caught between reality and memory. Its face was obscured by a screen of shifting data.  

Jonathan approached slowly. The air around him thickened, charged with something unseen.  

**“You are here now,”** the voice said again. **“But you must ask yourself: what is it you seek?”**  

Jonathan paused. For the first time since waking, he felt something stir within him—not memory, not knowledge, but a question. A need.  

“What is it I seek?”  

The figure in the chair didn’t move. The screen flickered, and for an instant, Jonathan saw something—his face, young, filled with purpose, his eyes alive with fire. Then it was gone.  

**“You are seeking yourself,”** the voice said at last. **“But to find you, you must first remember.”**  

Jonathan looked down at his hands again. The scars, the calluses. He had built things. Fought things. Done things that left their mark on him.  

He closed his eyes and took a breath.  

And for the first time in a long while, he
