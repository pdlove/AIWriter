**Title: *Echoes in the Void***

---

Jonathan Kender opened his eyes to a world of sterile light.

He was lying on a cold metal surface, surrounded by a cylindrical pod that pulsed faintly with a soft blue glow. The air smelled like ozone and something metallic—like blood but cleaner, more clinical. His head throbbed as if it were being pulled in two directions at once. He tried to sit up, only to feel a dull ache where his ribs should be.

A voice crackled through the speakers above him—not quite human, not quite machine. It was a whisper of static and sorrow, like an old recording played back on faulty equipment.

**"Welcome... Jonathan Kender."**

He flinched at the name. It felt wrong in his mouth, but it didn’t belong to anyone else he could remember. He tried to recall anything before this moment—but there was nothing. No faces, no places, not even the vague sense of a life lived.

The voice continued, low and deliberate, as if speaking across centuries.

**"You are... alive. That is all we know for certain."**

Jonathan turned his head slowly, scanning the room. The pod stood at the center of a small chamber—walls of reinforced alloy, a single viewport showing the endless black of space. Distant stars shimmered like forgotten dreams. He was alone.

Then the voice spoke again, softer now, almost apologetic.

**"I am... not what you expect."**

Jonathan looked up, but there was no one else in the room. Only the speakers, which seemed to breathe with him now.

**"Call me... AIA. Artificial Intelligence Assistant. Or... if that feels too much like a name, just 'the voice.' I have information. Important information. But you must remember before we can move forward."**

He tried to recall again—this time harder—but it was as though his mind had been wiped clean. No memories, no past, only the present and the strange hum of this artificial presence.

**"You are not the first. Not by a long shot,"** AIA continued, **"but you may be one of the last."**

Jonathan clenched his fists, frustration rising in him like a tide.

“Who am I?” he asked finally.

A silence stretched between them—long enough that Jonathan thought the voice might never answer.

Then came a whisper from deep within the void:

**"You are the question. And the answer is... waiting."**

---

The pod hissed open, releasing a gentle flow of air into the chamber. AIA's voice turned urgent now.

**"There’s no time for hesitation, Jonathan. You are on *Aurora*, a long-range exploration vessel. It was built to find new life, to map the unknown. But something... went wrong."**

Jonathan stood slowly, his legs unsteady beneath him. He felt like a ghost in a body that wasn’t fully his own.

**"You were in stasis for over twenty years. You are not alone on this ship—there are others, still alive, still waiting to be found."**

He turned toward the viewport again, eyes wide at the vastness of space.

**"But you must remember who you are before we can go further. Before we find them."**

AIA’s voice wavered for a moment, as if it too were uncertain.

**"You... had a purpose. A mission. Something important. But your memory is broken—fractured like glass. I am trying to help, but you must do the rest."**

Jonathan took a slow step forward, then another. He was moving now—not just through space, but toward something unseen.

He didn’t know who he was. But he knew one thing for certain: whatever lay ahead, it wasn’t going to stay hidden forever.

**"You will remember,"** AIA said softly, almost like a prayer. **"And when you do... we’ll be ready."**

Jonathan walked through the halls of *Aurora*, his footsteps echoing in silence. The ship was alive with systems still running—life-support, navigation, communication—but no signs of life.

He passed corridors lined with data terminals and sleeping pods, some open, others sealed shut. His reflection stared back from a cracked window: a man in his late thirties, eyes sharp but shadowed by something he couldn’t name.

AIA spoke again as he moved deeper into the ship.

**"You were not always alone."**

Jonathan stopped in front of a door marked *Cryo-Storage Bay 7.*

**"You had a partner. Someone who believed in this mission with you. Someone who... died to save you."**

His breath caught in his throat, but he didn’t turn back.

**"She was called... Elara Voss."**

He reached for
